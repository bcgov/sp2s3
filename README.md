# sp2s3
Utility to move all files from a Sharepoint document library to s3, once or cron. Because Sharepoint supports extracting attachements of an incoming email to document library, the utility can therefore automate extracting email attachments to s3 via Sharepoint too.

Works for SharePoint 2010 and newer.

## Install
Choose one of the following verified methods

### From Source
Need latest git and nodejs

```
git clone https://github.com/bcgov/sp2s3.git
cd sp2s3
npm i
node . <opts>
```

### Docker
Need docker cli

```
docker build -t sp2s3 https://github.com/bcgov/sp2s3.git
docker run sp2s3 npm start -- <opts>
```

### Openshift
Need oc cli and logged into openshift target deployment project

```
oc new-app https://github.com/bcgov/sp2s3.git --strategy=source <-e ENV=VALUE> ...
```
An Openshift app is expected to be long running so env *CRON_TIME_SPEC* documented below is mandatory. If a specific time is set in *CRON_TIME_SPEC* rather than wildcard, it is also advised to set *CRON_TIME_ZONE* because time zone defaults to UTC by the builder image.

To uninstall, assuming the app name is the default *sp2s3* and there is no other app with duplicated name

```
oc delete all -l app=sp2s3 --grace-period=0 --force --cascade
```

## Usage
*sp2s3* takes following input parameters in the form of either command line option or environment variable, with command line option taking precedence
